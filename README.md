## About The Project

The **Passport Photo Resizer** is a free tool designed to solve a common problem: creating compliant passport or visa photos without compromising privacy or paying exorbitant fees. Traditional photo booths are costly, and online services often require you to upload your sensitive biometric data to their servers.

This tool leverages the power of the browser's HTML Canvas API to perform all image processing—loading, cropping, and resizing—directly on the user's device. Your photos are never sent over the network, offering absolute peace of mind.

## ✨ Key Features

-   🔒 **Absolute Privacy:** 100% client-side processing. Your photos never leave your computer.
-   📏 **Official Presets:** Pre-configured dimensions for major international standards (US, UK, Schengen, etc.).
-   🖼️ **Live Canvas Editor:** Intuitive visual guide for precise cropping and positioning.
-   🎨 **Customizable Output:** Choose between JPEG/PNG formats and set a background color.
-   📱 **Fully Responsive:** Seamless experience on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
-   🚀 **Fast & Free:** No sign-ups, no fees, no watermarks. Just a simple, effective tool.
